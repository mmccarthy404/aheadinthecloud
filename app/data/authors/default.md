I'm a solutions architect at BioNTech building up the company's data and analytics backbone in AWS. Together with my team, I build out global research use cases at the intersection of data production and consumption; we work closely to onboard and enable all scientists onto AWS and our inhouse platform technologies. 

Outside of work I'm never far from a computer. I'm a builder, and I've started dozens of projects and micro-SaaS's over the years based off of the latest trends. When I'm not in front of a screen I stay busy reading, hiking, and checking out local trivia nights.

I decided to build this blog to give direction to all of the building I find myself doing. I want to create content to enable everyone to use cloud technologies like AWS. Hopefully, readers will be able to apply learnings here in their day-to-day, and scale in a serverless way!
