I'm a solutions architect at BioNTech building up the company's data and analytics backbone in AWS. Together with my team, I build out global research use cases at the intersection of data production and consumption. So much of my job involves working directly with scientists, educating on AWS and our inhouse platform technologies, and enabling the company in a very hands-on way; I decided to start this blog to continue educating, improving my skills as a communicator, and keeping my *head in the cloud*
