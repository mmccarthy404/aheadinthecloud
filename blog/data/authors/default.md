I'm a solutions architect at BioNTech building up the company's data and analytics backbone in AWS! Together with my team, I build out global pre-clinical research use cases at the intersection of data production and consumption. Together, we work closely to onboard and enable all stakeholders onto AWS and our inhouse platform technologies. 

Outside of work I'm never far from a computer. I'm a *builder*, and I've started dozens of projects and micro-SaaS's over the years based off of the latest trends. When I'm not in front of a screen I stay busy reading (*nonfiction*), hiking (*mostly local, sometimes tropical*), and attending local trivia nights (*I can't say I ever win*).

I decided to build this blog to give direction to the *building* I find myself doing. I want to create content to enable people in the life science industries to use cloud technologies like AWS; scaling projects and workloads in an easy and *serverless* way. Hopefully my real-world experiences help out here, I'm excited to see where this blog goes!
